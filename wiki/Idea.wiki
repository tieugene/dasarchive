#summary Key ideas.

  * Each file has per-file metadata and links to tags
  * tags are:
    * hiearchical
    * in taggroup
    * taggroup are context

Simpler:

  * tags == folders
  * folders are nestable
  * some folders can't contain files
  * file can be in some folders in simultaneously

= Specification =

== Queries ==
  * set current folder
  * get used facets
  * get available subfolders

== DB structure ==

=== Nodes ===
  * */*
    * _parms_: None
    * _constraints_: None
  * *Facet*: _must_ contain Tag
    * _parms_:
      * name:str
      * multiple:bool - multiple tags of this Facets can be applied to File
      * mandatory:bool=True
    * _constraints_: None
  * *Tag*:
    * _parms_:
      * name:str
      * ro:bool - Tue=can't contains File
    * _constraints_:
      * oncreate & ro: add 2+ edges of self->Tag
      * name: unique in its parent (Facet/Tag)
  * *File*:
    * _parms_:
      * size:int
      * md5:uint128
      * filename:str
    * _constraints_: None

=== Edges ===
Compatibility matrix:
|| F\T   || / || Facet || Tag ||  File ||
|| /     || - ||       ||     ||       ||
|| Facet || - ||   -   || 1:M ||   -   ||
|| Tag   || - ||  M:M  || 1:M || -/M:M ||
|| File  || - ||   -   ||  -  ||  ?:?  ||

  * / -> Facet: the only edge from /; name = 'facet'.
  * Facet -> Tag: the only edge to Tag; name = 'include'.
  * Tag -> Facet:
    * _parms_:
      * onlyfor:bool - facet appliable for this Folder but not for children
    * _constraints_: None
  * Tag -> Tag: nested tags if File can be as in parent as in child tag (e.g. DocType -> DocSubType).
  * Tag -> File:
    * _parms_: None
    * _constraints_:
      * File can't has as Tag as it's child/parent simultaneously
    * File can has any Tag from:
      * / childen Tags
      * sub-TagGroup from / to applied
  * File -> File: sequience and/or X-link
    * _constraints_:
      * File sequence/X-links can't contain loops (a File can't be twice in sequence/X-links chains)
      * => File can be in one sequence and one X-links group (?)

=== Questions ===
  * Move TagGroup through hierarchy (up-down)
  * / is Tag?
  * Super-node Class? (Tag/File etc)
  * Really srict hierarchy of tags?
  * Must depricate X-tags upper then defined level (like - music tags and documens ones)
  * Maybe - tags have "compatibility table"?
  * == a kind of "scheme"
  * what about "SubClassOf" and "ChildOf" parameters? (RTFM RDF/OWL)
  * => SemaWeb :-)
  * Однако - DB independen

== UI ==

= Ideas =
  * folder parm: "OnlyFor": list of folders (with or without children) == Tag -> Facet
  * Other nodes: contact, task, address
